Flavor Trends That are Here to Stay
What is the next kale? Are consumers done with sriracha? What is chocho? Do you ever find yourself anxiety baking? Kalsec compiled a list of top food trends from expert sources in the food industry. In doing this, we developed our own predictions for 2019. We encourage you to read through several of the sources and make note of the similarities and differences.

Our Predictions for Food and Flavor Trends
2019 will be a year for specificity. This means global flavors from specific regions of the world, naming pepper varietals in foods and a preference for not only clean label, but clear label.


Globally Inspired
We expect to see even more region-specific flavors going global and entering product development as consumers continue to travel the world and try new foods. Regional flavors that we are seeing show up on lists include West African, Pacific Rim and Latin American.

Spicy Specificity
Hot and spicy flavors are getting more specific and complex. Consumers want more than just ‘hot’ or ‘mild.’ They want specific pepper varietals like ancho, poblano, guajillo and more. They are looking for both heat AND flavor from these peppers and want to pair them with other sweet, savory and tangy flavors.

Fermented Flavors
As consumers become increasingly interested in ethnic foods, fermented flavors have also seen a rise in popularity. Providing probiotic properties and umami flavors, fermented foods are showing up on restaurant menus and grocery store shelves more often.

Clear Label Attributes
Consumer ideals on what should and should not be on a label is ever-changing. We are seeing more consumers prefer to see more transparency on labels. They want to know more about processing techniques, people and animal welfare, and what is being done to improve environmental impact in the production process. We call these types of information clear label attributes as they are an evolution of clean label attributes.

Plant-Based Proteins
The trend for plant-based proteins is expected to expand even more in 2019. More companies are widening their vegetarian and vegan options to attract flexitarian and other dieting consumers. This means traditional vegetarian options like the black bean burger are being joined by plant-based proteins made to look and taste like actual meat.

Alcohol Infusions
Driven by Millennials, the trend for alcohol in food will appear more in 2019. Foodies are finding that alcohol flavors pair well with traditionally savory and sweet notes. Tying in to the craft beer craze, consumers are now more than ever interested in seeing specific flavor pairings with their favorite foods. On the opposite side of this spectrum, we are also seeing an increase in interest for non-alcoholic artisan cocktails and beverages.

Handcrafted at a Premium
Foods that tell a story or offer additional benefits are increasingly preferred by consumers. The rise of craft products like beer, cheese, baked goods and meat has led to an artisan food movement that reaches far beyond traditional homemade products. Consumers are looking to splurge more often and want signature crafted and premium products that tell a story they can relate to.
