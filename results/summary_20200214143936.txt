 Because there is no alternative way of urea synthesis, blockade in the urea cycle results in devastating health consequences. Because the gene is on X-chromosome, OTC deficiency is much more prevalent in males. 1A). 1B), indicating a critical role in OTC function. 1C). 1D). To directly detect OTC K88 acetylation, we raised antibody against an acetylated K88 OTC peptide. Therefore, acetylation of K88 will likely affect its enzymatic activity. 2A). 2B). 3A). 4A). At the same time, OTC activity was increased by lowering glucose levels in cell culture medium (Fig. Consistently, the K88Q has a much weaker affinity towards the substrate carbamoyl phosphate and is almost completely inactive (less than 1% of the wild type activity). Therefore, cells must adapt to metabolic pathways to get rid of ammonium. 4A). Therefore, the urea cycle activity is repressed in the abundance of glucose. Therefore, OTC activity may be regulated by cellular energy status. Consistently, OTC activity is inhibited by high amino acids. Oechsner, M., Steen, C., Sturenburg, H. J., and Kohlschutter, A. McCullough, B. Waltzer L, and M., B. Bouras, T., Fu, M. F., Sauve, A. A., Wang, F., Quong, A. Arranz, J. Hayase, K., Yonekawa, G., and Yoshida, A. C. Transfected OTC is acetylated. D. Endogenous OTC is acetylated. E. OTC is acetylated on K88. Fig 2. Fig 3. Proteins were purified by IP and OTC activity assays were determined. Proteins were purified by IP, total acetylation level, K88 acetylation level, and OTC activities were determined, respectively. OTC activity kinetic parameters presented as mean +/- SD. Fig 4. A. Glucose increases OTC acetylation and decreases activity. Proteins were purified by IP. OTC activity, OTC acetylation and K88 acetylation were each carried out for purified proteins. Proteins were purified by IP. OTC activity, OTC acetylation and K88 acetylation were each carried out for purified proteins. Biol. Chem.
